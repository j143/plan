# ADR-002: Communication Model Implementation

## Status
In review (2025-09-05)

## Context
Accurate communication modeling is critical for distributed training simulation, but we lack access to physical GPU clusters.

## Decision
- Base communication model on published NCCL benchmark data
- Implement both Ring and Tree AllReduce algorithms
- Model bandwidth and latency characteristics separately
- Use protocol switching thresholds from NCCL documentation
- Validate against MLPerf and vendor benchmarks

## Consequences
- Avoids need for physical hardware measurements
- May have up to 15% accuracy deviation from real systems
- Enables modeling of different network topologies
- Limited to operations with published benchmark data
